Multiple Flask extensions laid the foundation for most of the features, so big thanks to the people who authored and keep on maintaining them. List of extensions used:

- ORM: Flask-SQLAlchemy
- form handling: Flask-WTF
- security and auth: Flask-Login and Flask-Bcrypt
- content styling: Flask-Markdown
- full-text search functionality: SQLAlchemy-searchable

[demo](http://algiii.herokuapp.com)

test id: username = test | password = satuduatiga

## list of features

- user authentication, basic admin/non-admin role implementation, page restriction

- multiple security measures: csrf protection, cookie protection, passwords hashed with salt, registration with otp, form validations

- blogging features: CRUD functionality, Markdown support, content pagination, draft system, featured posts, categories, tags, post filters, full-text search, comments

And plenty of smaller ones which I'm too lazy to list.
